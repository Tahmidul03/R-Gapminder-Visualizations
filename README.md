This is my first major Data visualization Project using "R". For this project, I am referencing the GapMinder Dataset which is one of the Default datasets you can easily install in R. 
The first step I did was perform bit of Data Wrangling meaning Re-organizing the dataset slightly to where you only want to analyze data from 1950 onwards.
Then I designed 6 different plots and graphs discussing various applications (note the titles on each visualizations) based on my updated GapMinder data. 
I also created a Shiny Dashboard Interactively which displays 2 visualizations on One webframe. Each visualization also analyzes a specific scenario.
